Design Decisions:


-Desktop

	Decided to spend time for a good half then for a less 

quality full.


Colors: 

Header - Beige for the easiness on the eyes and soothing.

Tan for the hover effect. For good contrast.

Grey as requested by spec.

Banner Bubble - White with 0.5 opacity to see the photo behind. 

Banner Button - Brown for background. Color Beige, for good 

contrast. Crimson for hover effect. 

Side Panel 1 - Dark Brown for matching the img color of banner.  

Smooth transition. Dark Green for matching the green trees in 

the img. White background for text for easy reading.

Side Panel 2 - Dark Purple complementing the dark brown and to 

provide contrast to the beige. Tan for hover effect. Brown for 

read more button. Crimson for active. For a subtle but noticable 

change.

Footer - Black background to help blend the two panels together.

White color for good contrast and ease of reading.


Animations:

Banner Bubble - three second transition to set the mood to 

a 'waking up'/ 'easing' into the site.

Side Panel 2 - padding left to make the site more alive and 

interactive. 


Fonts:

Used 'Italianno', cursive for banner bubble title. For elegrance 

and to show class.

Used 'Cutive Mono', monospace for panel 1 middle text to 

seperate from the rest of the text and to provide more 

easiblity for reading.


Ect:

Decided to leave nav bar on top for a clean experience and 

a moving nav bar for mobile version. 

________________________________________________________________


-Mobile

	I did mobile first and spend time for the full site.


Colors:

nav bar - greens to compliment the blues. Also for calming 

effect.

body and footer - blues for a calming and clean effect. 

Also to show elegrance. 

Dashed borders for clear seperation and easy on the eyes.

White background for clean and easy readablity.


Animations:

panel 2 photo bubbles - active translate to make it feel you're 

reading text messages on the phone.

panel 3 online classes - margin left for more interactive 

experience and visual experience. 


Fonts:

Used 'Italianno', cursive  for showing class and elegrance. Used

in the beginning and the end of site to show there's elegrance

throughout the site. 

Used 'Cutive Mono', monospace for second panel for ease of 

readability and a more clean experience. Also to seperate

from the other panels of the page. 


Ect:

I choose more of a bubble look for the image and text to give it 

a 'text message conversation' vibe.
